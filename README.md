[00:01.28] Yes, I believe in a miracle
[00:03.22] But there's nothing so in particular
[00:05.12] But I found the words to show this feeling
[00:09.34] It's not because that I'm spiritual
[00:11.05] And I know that it's not perpetual
[00:13.01] But I found the words to show
[00:14.95] And now I know who I am for

[01:18.66] 
[00:57.38] Yes, I believe in a miracle
[00:59.36] But there's nothing so in particular
[01:01.26] But I found the words to show this feeling
[01:05.40] It's not because that I'm spiritual
[01:07.27] And I know that it's not perpetual
[01:09.04] But I found the words to show, and I know who I am for
[01:36.04] 
[01:21.21] 12 times, I have told you lie, yeah
[01:25.27] 4 times, you have said goodbye
[01:29.15] Each time, I remember surely, appreciation to you
[01:35.22] Well frankly, shortly, marry me?
